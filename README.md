Business Fraud Detection - INSAID INTERNSHIP TASK

This task requires interns to construct a model that can predict fraudulent transactions for a financial organization and use the insights derived from the model to formulate a strategic plan. The dataset for this task, comprising 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns, is provided in CSV format. Interns are free to utilize any method to develop their machine learning model. As per the standard model development procedures, the model should be trained on the calibration data and validated on the test data. This task necessitates both statistical analysis and the application of creativity and judgment. It is recommended to allocate adequate time for both fine-tuning the model and interpreting its results.
